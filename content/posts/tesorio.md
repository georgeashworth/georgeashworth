Tesorio is hiring engineers. We are building the next generation of accounting software. Business transactions, payments, and reconciliations linger decades behind the speed and convenience of the consumer sector. Let’s fix that.

Together we’ll be working on algorithms to understand cash needs at companies, integrations that let accounting systems talk to one another and the next generation of B2B payments that are as simple as Venmo.

Our investors include Y-Combinator, First Round Capital, Floodgate Capital, Fuel Capital, Red Swan, Slow Ventures, Hillsven Capital, and Paul Buchheit (creator of Gmail).
