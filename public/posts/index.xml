      <description>We’re building the destination for getting things done.
Customers needed help connecting to qualified, local professionals. The same professionals needed customers. As a solution to bring the two together, Thumbtack was born.
Since then, we’ve helped millions of customers with their projects and generated more than $1 billion in annual revenue for our pros. We’re reshaping local economies. We’re changing lives. And true to the spirit of our customers and pros, we’re getting things done.</description>

      <description>Tesorio is hiring engineers. We are building the next generation of accounting software. Business transactions, payments, and reconciliations linger decades behind the speed and convenience of the consumer sector. Let’s fix that.
Together we’ll be working on algorithms to understand cash needs at companies, integrations that let accounting systems talk to one another and the next generation of B2B payments that are as simple as Venmo.
Our investors include Y-Combinator, First Round Capital, Floodgate Capital, Fuel Capital, Red Swan, Slow Ventures, Hillsven Capital, and Paul Buchheit (creator of Gmail).</description>
